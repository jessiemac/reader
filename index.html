"On the question of masculinity and feminity, we could continue our analysis, to refine it and perhaps reach the point where the mythic, the ideological and the utpoian meet. The mythic relates to origins, foundations, Eve, Aphrodite; the ideological relates to interpretation, women's real role in contemporary society, what can be said about it, the critiques that can be made of it, the projects that can be built around women; lastly, the utopian realtes to happiness and the absolute as we dream and half-dream it, mingled with reality at the level of half-dreaming."

"I shall make a distinction between chronological adults and adulthood [<i>les adultes d'age - et l'age adulte</i>], which seems quite different to me. We present adulthood to children and young people as a goal to be attained. It is understood that after a series of initiations for which, by the way, they are responsible because initiation ceremonies have disappeared, they will reach adulthood, and that adulthood is the supreme test." <i>pg. 105</i>

	I should like to emphasize one point: in industrial society, the everyday manifests itself as a discrete <i>level.</i> In previous societies, everyday life was incomparably more integrated into the culture as a whole - into religious life, for example, it was not separate from it. In our society this is an increasing disparity between the level of the everyday and the higher levels - those of politics and the State, high technology, or high culture, for instance. This gap widening and heps to define the everyday as such, as a level. Futhermore, at the same time as it is gradually becoming defined as a level, the everyday is spreading and levelling out throughout industrial society, in all countries, and in all the cultures that are subordinate to industrial society; and it is becoming uniform, in other words, defined.
